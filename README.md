This jupyter notebook contains three simple 3D grpahs plotted via matplotlib in python.


Here the most interesting (or arguably most confusing) part is to use **numpy.meshgrid** for quickly creating all necessary 3D coordinates in matrices.
For details please see below official documentation:

More complicated 3D graphs can be found in Matplotlib's official tutorial:
